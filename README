Known issues:
A user has reported experiencing frequent pausing while loading deck.  Will add more details as reported.
Turns out every time a card is loaded which includes a space the pause is being triggered.  

Since this issue is only affecting a small sample size of users our fix for the time being will be implementing a config file to change hotkeys.
